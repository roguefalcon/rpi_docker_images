      <p>I'm going to assume Vim for the rest of this tutorial and weave the instructions
         on how to use it throughout.  If you don't want to use Vim the other editors will
         work fine.  Just ignore the vim commands.</p>

      <p>Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python.  It is very simple because it only
         requires a few lines of code to make a complete web application.  Let's create a new file called hello.py
         and make our first flask app.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
vim hello.py</pre>
      </p>

      <p>When you first start Vim it starts in what is called Visual mode.  This is hotkey mode.  The hotkeys are
         the power of Vim.  But getting started we just want to type in text.  Press `i` to go into Insert mode and
         then you can start typing like you'd expect.  If you get stuck at any point.  Press the escape key a
         few times and then press `i`.  Escape takes you back to Visual mode.</p>

      <p>This is what we want in our file.  You can copy paste into you putty window or terminal.  With putty
         it is a right click to paste.  You must be in insert mode in Vim before you can paste (press `i`).
         Then look for the `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the screen.

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Include Flask and setup the application object
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

# The index page
@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

# Runtime settings
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True, threaded=True)
         </pre>
      </p>

      <p>If you are using Putty the comment colors are probably a very dark blue that is hard to read.
         You can change that by clicking on the icon in the top of the window.  Then click on Change
         Settings -&gt; Colours -&gt; and select the color for `ANSI BLUE` and make it 110 110 255
         and click apply.  Might be a good time to also disable the annoying bell sound.</p>

      <p>Let's discuss what each group of lines is doing</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>#!/usr/bin/python3</pre></p>

      <p>This line tells the server which program to use to run this file.  In our case we are using
         the python3 program to interpret/run the file.  This line is called the `shebang`.  I'm
         honestly not sure why we call it that (neither is Wikipedia) but if you Google 
         `shebang python` you'll see that I'm not crazy.  I think it's because we are in the `Shell`
         and in the old days of typing the ! was called a `bang` and over time it was shortened
         to `shebang` but I'm just guessing.  When I started coding the # was called a `pound` and
         not a `hashtag`.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Include Flask and setup the application object
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)</pre></p>

      <p>This section starts by pulling code into your program.  The `from flask import Flask` is telling
         python to put the code in the Flask module in scope so you can use it.  The second line creates
         a new object called app and set's it as a Flask object.  The __name__ is a python trick to send
         the name of your app to the Flask function.  I wouldn't worry about that part to much.  If you really
         want to know then the value of __name__ is almost always going to be the string "__main__".</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# The index page
@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"</pre></p>

      <p>This code is the `meat` of the program.  In Flask each function is a single screen of a web application.
         In this case the @app.route("/") is telling Flask the url at http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000<b>/</b> is
         should run the hello() function.  The magic is the / at the end of the url.  If we had wanted
         http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000<b>/asdf</b> then our line would have read @app.route("/asdf").  We'd say
         that we are mapping a url to a function.  The return "Hello World!" is the string that will display in the
         browser.  We will make this more complex later in the tutorial.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Runtime settings
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)</pre></p>

      <p>This section is telling the Flask app how to run.  The first line `if __name__ == "__main__":` is a
         python trick to determine if you are the running application or if someone else imported you.  If you
         don't understand this then I wouldn't stress out about it.  Just know it makes your program safer.
         The second line `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)` actually runs the Flask app
         with a few arguments.  The host='0.0.0.0' is saying run on any IP Address.  The port=5000 is
         asking for the specific port on the server (this is another complex subject that you don't
         fully need to understand but Kenny is happy to explain to you).  The last argument `debut=True` makes your life
         easier because it prints errors to the browser screen and terminal as well as reloading the program
         if any changes are made.  You don't want this turned on in Production but for development it's great!</p>

      <p>Now that you have everything in your file it's time to save it.  Press escape and then type `:w`.</p>

      <p>You will now want to open a second terminal.  If you are using putty, you can do this by clicking
         on the icon and click `Duplicate Session`.  You'll need to type your password.  Then change into the
         same directory.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
cd hello_world
ls
chmod u+x hello.py
ls -l</pre></p>

      <p>It should look something like the items below.

      <p><img src='/static/img/hello_world/step.5.jpg'></p>

      <p>You've seen the `cd` and `ls` before.  The <b>chmod u+x hello.py</b> is telling the linux
         system that you what to change the mode of this file (`chmod`) to allow the user (`u`) to
         be allowed to run or execute (`+x`) the file hello.py.</p>

      <p>When you type `ls -l` it is saying list everything in long format.  There you can see the
         permissions on the files, who owns them, how big they are (in bytes) and the date and time
         they were created.  There is a simple way to learn permissions and that is to remember The old
         Yugo cars from the 1980s.</p>

      <p><img src='http://www.carbuzz.com/resizeimg/imageshandler.ashx?w=640&h=480&url=http://db.carbuzz.com/images2/220000/6000/900/226923.jpg' width=250px></p>

      <p>Drop the `y` and you are left with `ugo` which stands for user - group - other.  In the picture
         of the terminal above you can see the line that says hello.py starts with `-rwxr--r--`.  This
         is telling you the permissions of the hello.py file.  The first - is reserved for something special
         so you can ignore it.
         The next three characters `rwx` are saying the User (remember Ugo) has read write and execute permissions on
         the file.  The next three characters `r--` is saying that the members of the Group (uGo) have read permissions
         but can not write or execute.  The last three characters are showing that everyone else or `Other` (ugO) has
         read permissions.  It's normallly best not to let people have read permissions on your personal files.  In this case
         it's probably ok since this is a Hack-a-thon and these are your personal files on your personal VM.  If you want
         to lock it down you can issue `chmod o-r hello.py` and it will remove that last r.</p>

      <p>We did all of that so we could run our program.  Whew.  Now issue the following command in your new terminal.<p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
./hello.py
      </pre></p>

      <p>If it worked you will see this.</p>

      <p><img src='/static/img/hello_world/step.5.2.jpg'></p>

      <p>If not you probably need to ask for help.</p>

      <p>Step 5 is almost complete.  Now let's go to a browser and see if we can load our
         Hello World web page.</p>

      <p>This link should work <a href='http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000/' target='_new'>http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000/</a> (opens a new tab).</p>

      <p>If everything went according to plan you should see two new lines in the 2nd terminal window.<p>

      <p><img src='/static/img/hello_world/step.5.3.jpg'></p>

      <p>  I'm using Chrome
         so it fetched the index page (`GET /`) and then tried to get the icon file (`GET /favicon.ico`).  The first one
         worked and issued a 200 (which means Success).  The second one didn't work since we don't have an icon.  It
         issued a 404 code.  That code means Not Found.  These are called HTTP Status Codes.  You don't need this right now but for the future, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_errors' target='_new'>here</a> 
         is the complete list of codes that you could see.</p>

      <p>Every time you reload the page you should see another line in the terminal.  If possible try to get your terminal
         and your browser aligned so you can see both at the same time.  In a perfect world you'd be able to see your
         code, the terminal running flask and the browser window at the same time.  A laptop might make this difficult.

      <p>Congrats!  You just built your first python flask app!  Now let's make it do something.</p>
