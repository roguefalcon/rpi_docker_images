      <h2>Git Basics</h2>

      <p>You've now been assigned to a team, you can see on the wall there are a ton of post-it
         notes representing work that you are supposed to do.  There are a bunch of poeple
         that are going to work on the same code.  How do we avoid messing each other up?
         This magic is simple.  We will use a tool called a code repository.
         We've decided to go with the most popular one on the planet called 'Git'.
         Let's walk through the basics.

      <p>We need to setup your access to the code repository server.<p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
ssh-keygen -t rsa
# press enter 3 times at each prompt</pre></p>

      <p>The command above will ask you which file to save your key in then it will
         ask you twice for your password.  Just press enter to select the default
         file and press enter two more times to leave your password blank.
         Here is a picture of the entire process:<p>

      <p><img src='/static/img/start_working/step.3.png'></p>

      <p>Now we need to copy this key to the git server with the following command:</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
ssh-copy-id {{request.cookies.username}}@git.pyatt.lan </pre></p>

      <p>A few things are going to happen.  It will copy the key and then prompt you
         for your ssh password.  Then it will tell you to login to the server to
         see if it worked.  Finally you will logout of the machine to get back to your server.</p>

      <p><img src='/static/img/start_working/step.3.2.png'></p>

      <p>If you haven't already, login to the git.pyatt.lan server and verify that it
         <u>did not</u> ask you for a password.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
ssh {{request.cookies.username}}@git.pyatt.lan</pre></p>

      <p>To logout you can type `logout` or you can press `ctrl-d`.</p>

      <p>Now let's get the code repository and learn some basic git commands.<p>

      <p>You've been assigned to a team (if not ask for Kenny or Stephen), the name of that
         team closely aligns with the project you are working on.  There is a pre-created
         code repository named the same as your group name.</p>

      <p>Here is a key:</p>

      <p>
         Team Name - repo name<br/>
         Web UI Team - web<br/>
         <!--Web API Team - webapi<br/>-->
         CRM UI Team - crm<br/>
         CRM API Team - crmapi<br/>
         Ops UI Team - ops<br/>
         Ops API Team - opsapi<br/>
         Mobile App Team - mobile<br/>
         Mobile API Team - mobileapi<br/>
      <p>

      <p>From your home folder you will want to <b>`clone`</b> the git repository for your
         project.  Here is an example if you were on the crmapi team.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
cd
#Typing `cd` by itself on a line takes you bak to your home folder.

git clone {{request.cookies.username}}@git.pyatt.lan:/srv/git/crmapi.git
</pre></p>

      <p>Notice at the end of the line there is a crmapi.git file.  Switch that out for your team's repo.</p>

      <p>You should see the following:</p>

      <p><img src='/static/img/start_working/step.3.3.png'></p>

      <p>Now you can type `ls` and see the new repo.  Let's `cd` into the repo.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
cd crmapi
ls</pre></p>

      <p>You will see some basic files.  Nothing to crazy, the work isn't done yet. I put just
         enough in each repo to get it started (except mobile, you guys are starting from scratch).
         Let's start looking at some basic git commands.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
# Look at the current status of your git repo
git status

# Add a file to your git repo (if git status says it's `untracked`)
git add [filename]

# Commit (save) your changes to your local repository
git commit -am "[tweet style message about your update]"

# Get all the changes your teammates have been doing
git pull

# Send your changes to the group repository server
git push</pre></p>

      <p>These git commands are in the order that you will run them as you work.  If you
         do this in this order, and your team doesn't assign two people to work on
         the same file at the same time you should never hit a merge conflict.
         If you hit a merge conflict ask for a Mentor to help you.  Otherwise, you
         will risk losing some code.</p>

      <p>There was some debate around using a `branching` strategy during HackMT.  We've
         decided not to but you should really Google `git flow branching strategy` and
         read up on it after HackMT.</p>
