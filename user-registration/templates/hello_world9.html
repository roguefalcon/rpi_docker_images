      <p>Jump back into your hello.py file (`vim hello.py`). We are going to add several more imports to
         get all the code we need to do everything the login will need to do.  Add these to the top
         of your file in the imports section above the line `app = Flask(__name__)`.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
from flask import request
from flask import redirect
from flask import url_for
from flask import session
from flask import flash
import bcrypt
import sqlite3</pre></p>

    <p>Python wants you to do each import on a separate line so it's more readable.  Guido (the creator of Python)
       believed that since code is read more often than it is written, it should be as readable as possible.</p>

    <p>Now we need to setup the SQL Connection.  Let's do this in a new section below the line `app = Flask(__name__)`.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# The SQL connection ==========================================================
conn = sqlite3.connect('sql.db', check_same_thread=False)
# This tells SQLite that I want dictionaries instead of tuples for fetch statements
conn.row_factory = lambda c, r: dict([(col[0], r[idx]) for idx, col in enumerate(c.description)])
# SQL cursor
c = conn.cursor()</pre></p>

    <p>We are doing things similar to the read_sql.py and load_sql.py with a few differences.  In the first line
       we've hadded the `check_same_thread=False` which will allow SQLite to run in flask in a manner that
       is Thread safe.  The Thread Safe topic is to big for this tutorial.  Feel free to ask Kenny.</p>

    <p>The conn.row_factory line is advanced Python which slightly violates the `readable` rule.  The comment
       gives the clue that I want to get back Python Dictionaries with key/value pairs instead of just
       tuples full of values.  This will make our lives easier when we load data from the database into templates.</p>

    <p>The final line is the same as the database scripts. It gives us a cursor that will let us execute statements.</p>

    <p>Now we are ready to write the login function.  I'm going to paste the entire thing here and let you copy/paste it.
       Then we will go through each section in the same manner we've been working.</p>

    <p>We need to rename the hello() function to be index() so our program will make more sense.</p>
    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
def index():</pre></p>

    <p>Paste this after the return line in the index() function.  I leave two empty lines between functions.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Login =======================================================================
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():

   # First let's confirm they sent us a username and password.
   if not request.form['username'] or not request.form['password']:
      flash("No username or password entered")

      return redirect(url_for("index"))

   # Let's check their password against the database
   c.execute('SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=?', (request.form['username'],))
   user = c.fetchone()

   # Let's check the bcrypt password
   if bcrypt.checkpw(request.form['password'].encode('utf8'), user['password']):

      # This actually 'logs' the user in by saving the username in the session
      session['username'] = request.form['username']

      # Take them to the browse page (they made it in)
      return redirect(url_for("browse"))

   # The login didn't work
   else:

      # Let's tell them they need to try again
      flash("Login failed")

   # We need to go back to the index page
   return redirect(url_for("index"))</pre></p>

   <p>Now let's discuss each part of the login function</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Login =======================================================================
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():</pre></p>

    <p>This section is very similar to the hello() function except that we are telling Flask
       we only want to accept the POST method for this function.  If you remember in our HTML
       &lt;form&gt; tag we put method="post" so these need to line up.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
   # First let's confirm they sent us a username and password.
   if not request.form['username'] or not request.form['password']:
      flash("No username or password entered")

      return redirect(url_for("index"))</pre></p>

    <p>In Flask the request object let's you access the data the user input into the HTML form.
       I am referencing the username and password values.  The test is basically saying
       if they submited the form without sending a username or a password let's tell them
       and reload the page so they have to try again.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
   # Let's check their password against the database
   c.execute('SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username=?', (request.form['username'],))
   user = c.fetchone()

   # Let's check the bcrypt password
   if bcrypt.checkpw(request.form['password'].encode('utf8'), user['password']):

      # This actually 'logs' the user in by saving the username in the session
      session['username'] = request.form['username']

      # Take them to the browse page (they made it in)
      return redirect(url_for("browse"))</pre></p>

    <p>This section has a lot going on.  First we query the database to get the username/password for this user.
       Then we check the password the user entered vs the one we have in in the database.  BCrypt offers the
       checkpw() function for this.  If the username is in the database and the password checks out we will
       use the Flask session object to save the username in the browser session.  Then we will take them
       to the browse screen (which we will create in a little bit).</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
   # The login didn't work
   else:

      # Let's tell them they need to try again
      flash("Login failed")

   # We need to go back to the index page
   return redirect(url_for("index"))</pre></p>

    <p>The else block here takes them back to the index page and tells them the login failed.</p>

    <p>Before we can test this we need to do one more thing.  The Flask session object needs setup
       at the bottom of our hello.py file. Update your Runtime Settings to the following.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Setting up Flask Sessions
    app.secret_key = 'Ssa0dfloi30s9adflkj3/{}asdf9#@'
    app.config['SESSION_TYPE'] = 'filesystem'

    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)</pre></p>

    <p>We are telling Flask Sessions to use the file system to store it's state and we are setting up a secret_key
       that will allow for encryption.  In order to make your app secure, you need to type random characters into
       the secret key.  It's fine if you just copy mine for this tutorial.</p>

    <p>Now save your file (:w).  If you have an error the 2nd terminal running flask may exit.  If it does fix
       the error and just run the hello.py again (./hello.py).</p>

    <p>To test your program you can do the following:

       <ol>
          <li>Click the Login Button without entering anything</li>
          <li>Enter a user without a password and click the Login Button</li>
          <li>Enter an incorrect username and password</li>
          <li>Enter the correct username and password (asdf/asdf) [Hint: this will error]</li>
       </ol>
    </p>

    <p>When you enter the correct username and password it will fail (werkzeug.routing.BuildError)
       because we haven't built the Browse function.  We will do that in the next step.</p>
