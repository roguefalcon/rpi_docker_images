    <p>Our program has one fatal security flaw that we need to fix.  When we added the login page
       we didn't put in any logic to force the user to go to the login screen if they aren't logged
       in.  We need to add that layer of security!</p>

    <p>To see what I mean click the `logout` button then visit <a href='http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000/browse' target="_blank">http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000/browse</a></p>
    <p>Oops!  Luckily Python Flask offers a simple solution to this problem.  There is an @app.before_request
       function that will allow you to run code before any other function on every single browser request.</p>

    <p>Let's add the following check_session() function to check if the user has a session and if not we can
       send them to the login screen.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Check the session to make sure they are logged in ============================
@app.before_request
def check_session():

   # if we don't see the session then we need to send them to the login
   if 'username' not in session or not session['username']:

      # We also don't want to send them to the login screen if they are looking for
      # Something insecure (i.e. static js files or if they are in the process of
      # Logging in.
      exclude_paths = ['/', '/login']
      if not re.search('static', request.path) and request.path not in exclude_paths:

         # We need to go back to the index page
         return redirect(url_for("index"))</pre></p>

    <p>Let's look at each section of this code.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Check the session to make sure they are logged in ============================
@app.before_request
def check_session():</pre></p>

      <p>This section starts with the @app.before_request decorator that tells Flask to
         run this function before every request.  Now it's important to understand that this
         will run before EVERY request, including the ones to static files like bootstrap.min.css.
         Since we don't want users to have to login to get CSS or JS files, we will have to handle
         that in the code below.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# if we don't see the session then we need to send them to the login
if 'username' not in session or not session['username']:</pre></p>

      <p>The session object is the magic on Flask sessions.  We look first to see if there is any
         value called username and then second to see if the value is populated with something.
         In Python the test `if variable` will test for the variable to have any value.
         at this point we are letting sessions live until the browser window is closed.  If you
         needed to limit a session to a specific amount of time you could add that to the session
         object.  Perhaps like session['expire_time'].</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# We also don't want to send them to the login screen if they are looking for
# Something insecure (i.e. static js files or if they are in the process of
# Logging in.
exclude_paths = ['/', '/login']
if not re.search('static', request.path) and request.path not in exclude_paths:</pre></p>

      <p>This section above allows us to ignore the pages in exclude_paths as well as any URL
         that contains the word static.  The re.search is a feature in Python to look for that
         pattern anywhere in a string.  In this case the url `/static/css/bootstrap.min.css` will match
         and we won't redirect them to the login page when they request the Bootstrap CSS.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# We need to go back to the index page
return redirect(url_for("index"))</pre></p>

      <p>We have one more thing we need to do before this code will run.  We are using a python
         built-in function called re.search() but we haven't imported the re object into our
         program's scope.  Let's include the following line at the bottom of our import section.</p>

      <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
import re</pre></p>

    <p>You should be good to test now.  If it isn't working ask for help from one of the industry
       professionals.</p>

    <p>This concludes our Hello, World Tutorial.  Whew.  That was a lot.</p>
