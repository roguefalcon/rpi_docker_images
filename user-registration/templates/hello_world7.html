    <p>Step 7 is going to introduce you to HTML 5 and Bootstrap 4.  In the last step you copy/pasted but now we
       need to discuss how each portion of it works.</p>

    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  The Markup is the key word.  HTML really is as simple as
       putting some 'markup' tags around things so Browsers know how to display them.  For example, if
       I want to make something bold I would put a set of &lt;b&gt; tags around it.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
The word is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;.</pre></p>

    <p>The &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; tags tell the browser where to start making things bold and where to stop.</p>

    <p>HTML files are divided into two sections.  The &lt;head&gt; and the &lt;body&gt;.  The head tells the browser
       general setup stuff and the body tells the browers what to do in the view window.

    <p>Let's take each block of the index.html file in pieces.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The DOCTYPE tells the browser which version of HTML we want to use.  This line used to be much crazier before
       HTML 5.  We decided to simplify it with HTML 5 since it was getting out of hand.

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
This was the OLD line for HTML 4.01 with the "strict" rules in case you thought I was kidding.
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The &lt;html lang="en"&gt; line starts the HTML section (which has the two
       parts of head and body) and sets the language to English.  The &lt;head&gt; line starts the head section of the
       file.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>These next couple of lines setup specific things about the characters the browse should expect to
       see in the HTML file as well as how to handle the browser window.  There is also a special line that
       Makes IE9 and IE10 not suck with Bootstrap.  For now just know it's better to have these lines
       so things you code will Do the Right Thing<sup>TM</sup>.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
  &lt;!-- Style --&gt;
  &lt;link href="static/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;link href="static/css/style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;!--/Style --&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>These lines pull in some Cascading Style Sheets.  If you think about these CSS files
       as layers of a water fall (or Cascades) then you can remember that the last one wins.
       Meaning if you define a style for the text color to be RED in the first file and
       then define the same text style to be GREEN in the last file.  The text will be green.
       That is why our "style.css" file is the last one defined.  So we can override the default
       Bootstrap styles if needed.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
  &lt;title&gt;Team KP - Hello World&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The &lt;title&gt; tag tells the browser what to display on the tab.  The &lt;/head&gt; ends the head section
       of the HTML document.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;body&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The &lt;body&gt; section is what will show up in the browser window.  It's where your content goes.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;!-- Content --&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-12"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--/Content --&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>This section is 100% Bootstrap 4. The &lt;div&gt; tag stands for division and it creates a visual
       and logical division on the page.  The class='' portion of the &lt;div&gt; tag allows you to apply a
       CSS Style class to that div.  The class='' syntax can be used in any HTML tag to add a CSS class
       Every piece of content in Bootstrap needs to be in a container.  I typically only have one of these per
       HTML file.  So the second line (after the comment) sets up the Bootstrap container.
       The next line creates a div with the class `row`.  Inside of it is another div with the class col-12.
       These &lt;div&gt; tags are setting up the Bootstrap Grid to determine where things are positioned on
       the screen.  Bootstrap ships with a `standard` 12 column grid.  The video below explains this grid.
    </p>

    <p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g3LRU3JF-rQ?start=28" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;!-- Javascript --&gt;
&lt;script src="static/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="static/js/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!--/Javascript --&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>These JavaScript libraries are included in the bottom of the &lt;body&gt; tag because by having
       them at the bottom it improves the speed at which the browser can 'paint' the page.  We will cover
       Javascript in a later step but for now these are the ones we need for Bootstrap 4 and Jquery 3.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-html'>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The final section of the file closes out the &lt;body&gt; section and then finally tells the browser
       that it's finished with reading all of the HTML.</p>

    <p>The primary goal of Step 7 is understanding this HTML and the Bootstrap Grid system.  I'd like to do
       a couple modifications to the index.html file so you can get comfortable manipulating both HTML and
       the Bootstrap grid.</p>

    <p>As we progress through this tutorial we are going to build an Application to track users
       favorite colors (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpx6XnankZ8&start=1m18s'>Monty Python reference</a>).
       Since this is top secret highly classified information, we need to make sure we add security to our
       application.  Let's turn this Hello, World index.html page into a login screen for our Favorite Color Tracker.</p>

    <p>Python Flask has an awesome feature called 'Flash Messages' that allows us to give the user information
       when the page loads.  We can use this Flash feature to tell the user if they messed up their login attempt.
       let's add a section to the login screen for displaying Flash messages under the Hello, World row.</p>


    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- New code goes here --&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-12"&gt;
     {&#37; with messages = get_flashed_messages() &#37;}
       {&#37; if messages &#37;}
         {&#37; for message in messages &#37;}
           &lt;div class="alert alert-warning"&gt;&#123;&#123;message&#125;&#125;&lt;/div&gt;
         {&#37; endfor &#37;}
       {&#37; endif &#37;}
     {&#37; endwith &#37;}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- End of new code --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>Notice that we put the code inside the container before the closing &lt;/div&gt; tag.  That code
       introduces a new concept.  Python Flask uses an HTML template language called Jinja that lets
       you write logic inside of your templates.  These &#123;&#37; foo &#37;&#125; tags will not
       display on the site.  Flask will substitute them for the output you want the user to see.</p>

    <p>&#123;&#37; foo &#37;&#125; - these are for directives like if and for statements.<br/>
       &#123;&#123;foo&#125;&#125; - these are for variable substitution.<br/>
       Notice there is a space between the &#37; and the foo on both sides but not on the variable tag.</p>

    <p>The Python `with` keyword works a lot like a Try/Except or Try/Finally block in a lot of other languages.
       it's basically a short cut way of saying Try this thing.  If it doesn't work fail gracefully.</p>
    <p>The Python `if` and `for` statements work for the most part like every other language.</p>

    <p>So this code snippet is saying, Attempt to load the flash messages (with) and if it doesn't work
       don't stress the user out about it (if).  Then display every message (for) that was flashed in a special &lt;div&gt;
       that has bright colors and scary fonts so they will see the message.</p>

    <p>Now we need to add the actual login form.  Put this block of code in the place the &lt;!-- End of new code --&gt; 
       line is in the block above.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-4"&gt;

      &lt;form method="post" action="/login"&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="username" name="username"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type="password" class="form-control" id="password" name="password"&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-8"&gt;
      &lt;!-- We could put a clever message here that welcomes our user but for now I'm leaving it blank.--&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre></p>

    <p>This code is using HTML 5 Form tags with Bootstrap 4 formatting.  We start by defining a new row and then
       creating a division that is only 4 columns wide.  This 4 column section is going to contain the login
       form.  Then we get into some new tags with the &lt;form&gt;.  I'll explain those in a bit.  The last part of the
       code creates an empty 8 column section.  We could put anything we want over there but for now I'm leaving
       it blank.  I assume that Jason Dupin will do something beautiful here in the final version of the app.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
&lt;form method="post" action="/login"&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The &lt;form&gt; tag tells the browser that we are going to capture input from the user.  The method
       attribute of `post` is telling the browser how to communicate this data with the server. During the
       Hack-a-thon we will send data via GET and POST.  The POST is considered more secure. If you are
       curious about the reason it's more secure you can ask one of the Industry Professionals.  The action
       attribute is telling the browser which URL to send the data to. In this case we are sending it to the
       /login URL.  For your flask app that would be http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5000/login.  We will create
       the /login in Step 8.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
  &lt;label for="username"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="username" name="username"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>The form-group class is a Bootstrap class that tells the browser to display the label and the input
       field together on the screen.  The Label will sit above the input field and doesn't do anything except
       assist the user in understanding what type of data to put in the field.  The &lt;input&gt; tag has
       a few super important attributes.  The type="text" tells the browser to expect text and display
       what they type.  In the next section it is type="password"  That tells the browser to expect a
       password and print *'s instead of the characters.  The id='username' attribute is for the browser
       to allow us to reference this field via JavaScript or CSS.  The name='username' field is for
       the server to know what data this.  It might seem silly to have both id='' and name=''.  I agree
       but that's just how we do it.  It is considered a best practice to keep these values the same
       so you are consistent in your programming.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
&lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Save&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre></p>

    <p>These last two lines are very simple.  The &lt;button&gt; tag creates a... button.  The type="submit" attribute
       on this tells the browser that when a user clicks this button it needs to perform the 'action' in the form
       tag.  We call it `submitting the form`.  The &lt;/form&gt; should be obvious.  It closes the form.</p>

    <p>One of the gotcha's for new developers is having more than one form on an HTML page and forgetting
       to close the form tag.  Don't do it!</p>

    <p>Now if you save your index.html (vim press `:w`) you should be able to see the following when you reload your
       browser window.  If you don't see that or get an error, ask for help.  This is a Hack-a-thon so time
       is critical :-).</p>
