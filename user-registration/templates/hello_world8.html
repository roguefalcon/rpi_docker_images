    <p>Now we are going to start actually doing some database driven web programming.  Woohoo!  Go ahead
       and save and quit out of the index.html file (escape then :wq).</p>

    <p>We are going to start by creating two scripts that will help setup (and reset) the database
       as well as give us some visibility into the current state of the database.  First we are going to create
       load_sql.py in our hello_world folder.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
vim load_sql.py</pre></p>

    <p>Now put the following in the file and we will talk through what it does later in this step.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Imported libraries
import sqlite3
import bcrypt
import os

# We want to remove the existing file
try:
    os.remove('sql.db')
except OSError as e:
    print("Couldn't remove the file:", e.strerror)

# The sql connection &amp; cursor
conn = sqlite3.connect('sql.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Make the tables =============================================================
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS favorite_color
             (name text, color text)''')

c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
             (username text, password text)''')

# Let's load some data
c.execute('''INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)''',
          ('asdf', bcrypt.hashpw(b'asdf', bcrypt.gensalt())))
conn.commit()
    </pre></p>

    <p>Save and exit the file (':wq').  We can't forget to change the permissions.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
chmod u+x load_sql.py</pre></p>

    <p>Now we can run it with the ./ trick</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint'>
./load_sql.py</pre></p>

    <p>This script runs 3 SQL statements using the python version of SQLite v3.  The actual
       database is stored in the file sql.db.  Let's look at the file and discuss the parts.
    </p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
#!/usr/bin/python3</pre></p>

    <p>We've discussed this already but for review, this is the shebang which tells linux
       what program to run to interpret this file.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Imported libraries
import sqlite3
import bcrypt</pre></p>

    <p>We've imported code before.  In this case we are importing SQLite and an encryption
       library called BCrypt that will let us save passwords in a safe way.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# We want to remove the existing file
try:
    os.remove('sql.db')
except OSError as e:
    print("Couldn't remove the file:", e.strerror)</pre></p>

    <p>This removes the file so we can start fresh.  We use a try/ except: block to protect us from
       the OS having an issue finding or removeing the file.  If it goes wrong the user will
       get a message telling them why.  os.remove() actually does the dirty work of taking the file
       out.  He's basically the hitman for Python files.  What you looking at?</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# The sql connection &amp; cursor
conn = sqlite3.connect('sql.db')
c = conn.cursor()</pre></p>

    <p>These two lines setup SQLite.  First line creates a connection to the database file and the second
       line creates a cursor that we will use to run statements.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Make the tables =============================================================
c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS favorite_color
             (name text, color text)''')

c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
             (username text, password text)''')</pre></p>

    <p>The c.execute() function let's us run a SQL Statement.  In these lines we are running CREATE statements
       to make two different tables.  The first table will hold the favorite_color data.  The second will hold
       which users are allowed to sign in to the application. Let's look at the parts of the SQL statement in
       more detail.  `CREATE TABLE` tells SQLite that we are making a new table.  The `IF NOT EXISTS` is a
       safety switch to make sure we don't overwrite an existing table. Then we list the name of the table.
       You might have noticed that the style shows that you are supposed to capitalize SQL keywords.  The portion
       in the parenthesis is defining table columns and the type of data we want to store.  So in this case
       we want to store a name value and a color value and both of those will be `text` types.  The other types
       are INTEGER, REAL, TEXT and BLOB. Integer is a non decimal number.  REAL is a decimal number.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Let's load some data
c.execute('''INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?)''',
          ('asdf', bcrypt.hashpw(b'asdf', bcrypt.gensalt())))</pre></p>

    <p>The INSERT sql statement loads data in a table.  We are creating a user named `asdf` with the password of
       `asdf` for the development environment.  The ?'s in the statement allow the c.execute() function to
       substitute in the values with the proper SQL escaping.  This is another on of those, making it safer moments.
       By using the ? instead of just putting your values directly into the SQL statement you are protecting
       yourself against malicious data.  Since this is your script, and you wouldn't intentionally put in bad data
       you can look at this as always following a best practice.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
conn.commit()</pre></p>

    <p>This last line is telling SQLite that it can write the changes to the file.  This is kinda like the `save`
       button in Microsoft Word.  If you don't save it and your program exits, there will be no changes to the
       database.</p>

    <p>If you didn't already run the load_sql.py script do so in the terminal with ./load_sql.py. When it runs it won't
       print anything but if you type `ls` you should see a new file called sql.db.</p>

    <p>Now let's make a script that will read the database and print it out.  We will create read_sql.py in the same folder.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
vim read_sql.py</pre></p>

    <p>Paste the following code into the file:</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Imported libraries
import sqlite3

# The sql connection &amp; cursor
conn = sqlite3.connect('sql.db')
c = conn.cursor()

# Print favorite_color ========================================================
print("==&gt; Favorite Colors")
c.execute('''SELECT * FROM favorite_color''')
colors = c.fetchall()

for color in colors:
    print(color)

# Print users =================================================================
print("==&gt; Users")
c.execute('''SELECT * FROM users''')
users = c.fetchall()

for user in users:
    print(user)</pre></p>

    <p>Since this file is very similar to the load_sql.py script, I'm only going to discuss the SELECT and the for loop.
       The SELECT statement queries data from a table.  In this example I am doing SELECT *.  This is a lazy way
       of saying that I want to pull every column.  On a production application it should be noted that SELECT * is
       a very bad idea.  In this script that we will only use for development, or when you are writing adhoc
       queries, this is fine.</p>

    <p>The Python for statement will pull one item off the object at a time.  In this case it will pull
       a single row at a time.  Again for small amounts of data this is fine.  For large amounts (like 10,000 rows
       or more) this might not be a good idea. For the Hack-a-thon it will be fine.  Let's run it and see
       what happens.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
chmod u+x read_sql.py
./read_sql.py</pre></p>

    <p>This was the output I saw</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
==&gt; Favorite Colors
==&gt; Users
('asdf', b'$2b$12$6qZXk96tEbJQv6DVa7G4jeYdhNFwAUnPaNwUUDOnLRMLzvSZuC.jS')</pre></p>

    <p>This makes sense since we didn't load anything in favorite_colors.  The crazy string for the user
       password is what BCrypt does to the `asdf` password.  It's very likely that your string will have
       different letters and numbers than mine.</p>

    <p>The next step is to update our hello.py to add the SQL capability as well as the /login function.  We will
       do that in the next step.</p>
