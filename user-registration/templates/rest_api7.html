    <p>Now we are ready to start building our API app.  If you did the Hello World tutorial, all the
       Python was in a single file.  Since this is dealing with 4 different types of data, we want to
       break the code up into multiple files.  To do that we will need to steup our very own Python
       module.</p>

    <p>Python uses a somewhat strange standard for building a module.  The module must be in it's own
       folder and it must have a file called __init__.py.  The __init__.py is the focus of this step.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python' style='background-color: #012'>
vim myapp/__init__.py</pre></p>

    <p>Now we need to add the following to that file.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Python Imports

from flask import session
from flask import request

    try:
        # The SQL connection ==================================================
        g.conn = sqlite3.connect('sql.db', check_same_thread=False)
        # This tells SQLite that I want dictionaries

        g.conn.row_factory = lambda c, r: dict([(col[0], r[idx]) for idx, col in enumerate(g.c.description)])
        # SQL cursor
        g.c = g.conn.cursor()
    except RuntimeError:
        print("FATAL: No database connection established")


# If someone comes here via a browser, let's tell them what this is
# This would also be a great place to host some documentation on
# What your API does and how to use it.
@app.route('/')
def index():

    return "Autonomous Car API"


# App Modules =================================================================
from myapp import passenger</pre></p>

    <p>Let's walk through the sections of the file.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Python Imports
from flask import Flask
from flask import g
from flask import session
from flask import request
from flask import redirect
import sqlite3</pre></p>

    <p>You always want to import your code at the top of a Python file.  It is a best
       practice.  Importing code throughout can cause issues in larger applications
       becuase you aren't always sure what has already been imported.  The lines above
       literraly pull in someone else's code into your program so you can use it.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Setup my flask object
app = Flask(__name__)</pre></p>

    <p>This defines the Flask app that everything will inherit and use.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Database Connection =========================================================
@app.before_request
def db_connect():

    try:
        # The SQL connection ==================================================
        g.conn = sqlite3.connect('sql.db', check_same_thread=False)
        # This tells SQLite that I want dictionaries
        # instead of tuples for fetch statements
        g.conn.row_factory = lambda c, r: dict([(col[0], r[idx]) for idx, col in enumerate(g.c.description)])
        # SQL cursor
        g.c = g.conn.cursor()
    except RuntimeError:
        print("FATAL: No database connection established")</pre></p>

    <p>This creates a database connection for your app and stores it in a "global" object.  Flask gives us the
       `g` object that you can store anything in.  It's great because we only have to define this connection
       once and it's available on every request.  We should add some logic to verify if we already have a
       connection but it's not mandatory and we aren't expecting a ton of traffic at this point.</p>

    <p>The `check_same_thread=False` allows SQLite to work safely in a threaded environment (like Flask).</p>

    <p>The g.conn.row_factory is one of those lines that isn't super readable but really helps us
       later in our programming.  It tell's SQLite that we want Lists of named Dictionaries instead of
       the default list of tuples behavior.  Basically it lets reference columns by name instead of by number.
       This will make sense over the next few steps.</p>

    <p>The try/except block is looking for an issue using the sql.db file.  This is very similar to the setup
       in the load_sql.py.</p>


    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# If someone comes here via a browser, let's tell them what this is
# This would also be a great place to host some documentation on
# What your API does and how to use it.
@app.route('/')
def index():

    return "Autonomous Car API"</pre></p>

    <p>APIs aren't intended to be visited from a browser.  If someone stumbles into
       this URL we want to tell them what it is.  As the comment says, it would be nice to give documentation here
       but this is a tutorial and in a Hack-a-thon we don't have time for everything we'd like to do.</p>


    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# App Modules =================================================================
from myapp import passenger</pre></p>

    <p>This line is telling our module that there is going to be a passenger.py file that we want
       to import.  You may have already guessed that the folder name is the name of the app.
       For the tutorial I chose to name our app, myapp.  Original, right?  Normally we'd do
       better than this.</p>

    <p>At the top of this Step I said import all of your modules at the top of the file.  This is
       normally what you'd do.  In this case, we can't import something that modifies the app object
       until after the app object is created.  Flask recommends this setup so this is what I do.</p>

    <p>__init__.py is finished.  Let's keep building this module in the next step.</p>
