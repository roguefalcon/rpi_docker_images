       <h2>Agile</h2>

      <p>This is not going to be a history of Agile.  Agile is a methodology (or process) by which software is
      developed.  The idea is pretty simple.  Work is broken down into small chucks and put in
      a <b>`product backlog`</b>.  Then the development team (or <b>`scrum team`</b>) decided what can be
      done in a certain amount of time and starts working.  That unit of time is called a <b>`sprint`</b>.</p>

      <p>There is a concept, that you will hear the mentors say to each other, called `MVP`.  In this case,
         it doesn't mean that we are watching for the best developer among you.  We are trying to find
         the Minimum Viable Product, or the simplest thing we can build to get the job done.  It
         means keep it simple on the first version.</p>

      <p>We are going to do a VERY simple version of Agile with sprints lasting only a few hours.</p>

      <p>At the end of a sprint, we send our work to <b>`production`</b>.</p>

      <p>Let's walk through an example.</p>

      <p>We are going to build a piece of software that powers a time machine.  So we have our agile board:</p>

      <table class="table table-bordered">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Backlog</th>
          <th>In Sprint</th>
          <th>Done</th>
          <th>Production</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
           <td>
              - Build Flux Capacitor<br/>
              - Purchase Delorean<br/>
              - Travel to 1955<br/>
           </td>
           <td></td>
           <td></td>
           <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The sprint team will discuss what can be done in a sprint and who
       is going to work on it.  For this sprint, they decide they can handle the first two <b>`user stores'</b>.
       They decide to assign the Flux Capacitor to Doc Brown and Marty will get the Delorean.  Now our
       sprint board looks like this:
    </p>

    <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Backlog</th>
        <th>In Sprint</th>
        <th>Done</th>
        <th>Production</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>
            - Travel to 1955<br/>
         </td>
         <td>
            - Build Flux Capacitor (Doc Brown)<br/>
            - Purchase Delorean (Marty McFly)<br/>
         </td>
         <td></td>
         <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Since this movie is only a few hours long, we will need to keep our sprints short.  So 30 minutes, later
       Doc slips on a toilet seat, hits his head and invents the Flux Capacitor.  This is not my
       recommended development style.</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Backlog</th>
        <th>In Sprint</th>
        <th>Done</th>
        <th>Production</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>
            - Travel to 1955<br/>
         </td>
         <td>
            - Purchase Delorean (Marty McFly)<br/>
         </td>
         <td>
            - Build Flux Capacitor (Doc Brown)<br/>
         </td>
         <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>10 minutes later Marty drives up in the all aluminum Delorean.  They are finished
       with development.  They will go to production under the instruction of their team leader.
       We will discuss the actual way to move to Prod in Step 5.</p>

    <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Backlog</th>
        <th>In Sprint</th>
        <th>Done</th>
        <th>Production</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>
            - Travel to 1955<br/>
         </td>
         <td>
         </td>
         <td>
            - Build Flux Capacitor (Doc Brown)<br/>
            - Purchase Delorean (Marty McFly)<br/>
         </td>
         <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Now we are ready to start the next sprint.  Since the last user story is pretty big,
       we decide to put two developers on it and start development.

    <table class="table table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Backlog</th>
        <th>In Sprint</th>
        <th>Done</th>
        <th>Production</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>
         </td>
         <td>
            - Travel to 1955 (Doc Brown &amp; Marty McFly)<br/>
         </td>
         <td>
         </td>
         <td>
            - Build Flux Capacitor (Doc Brown)<br/>
            - Purchase Delorean (Marty McFly)<br/>
         </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>You'll have to watch the movie to see if they finish the last sprint and ship the product on time
       or if they get fired and replaced with lower cost labor from Wakanda.</p>
