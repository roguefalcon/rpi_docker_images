      <p>Now it's time to create the API endpoints for the Passenger table.  An endpoint is a fancy name
         for each url in an API.  We are going to use the RESTful paradigm and the BREAD Acronym to design our
         endpoint.  Rest stands for `Representational state transfer`.  But you can forget that.  REST takes
         advantage of HTTP `verbs` to tell the server what the users intentions are.  HTTP `verbs` are
         the single words in all caps (i.e. GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, etc.).</p>

      <p>If you went through the Hello World tutorial, I mentioned that the industry adopted an acronym called
         CRUD to define the methods of an application as it relates to a the things you'd do to a table.  A small
         but dedicated group of us are trying to switch to the BREAD acronym because we feel CRUD sounds bad
         and doesn't really cover everything we need. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.  BREAD stands
         for Browse, Read, Edit, Add and Delete.</p>

     <p>We will design the Passenger API using the BREAD acronym and REST HTTP verbs. You don't need to memorize
        the following table but it shows what URLS, functions and HTTP Verbs align.</p>

     <p>
     <table class='table table-bordered'>
       <thead>
         <tr>
           <th>BREAD Keyword</th>
           <th>Endpoint URL</th>
           <th>HTTP Verb</th>
           <th>Purpose</th>
         </tr>
       </thead>
       <tbody>
         <tr>
            <td>Browse</td>
            <td>/passenger</td>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>List all passengers</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Read</td>
            <td>/passenger/id</td>
            <td>GET</td>
            <td>Details about a single passenger</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Edit</td>
            <td>/passenger/id</td>
            <td>PUT</td>
            <td>Edit single passenger</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Add</td>
            <td>/passenger</td>
            <td>POST</td>
            <td>Add a single passenger</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td>Delete</td>
            <td>/passenger/id</td>
            <td>DELETE</td>
            <td>Delete a single passenger</td>
         </tr>
       </tbody>
     </table>
     </p>

     <p>

     <p>REST doesn't suggest there can't be other endpoints, but these are the minimum you should support.
        with these you can do pretty much anything you'd need to do.  It's also worth mentionging
        that there is also a PATCH keyword.  The original idea was that PUT replaced an entire record and
        PATCH only replaced part of the record.  For this tutorial, we are only going to update the
        entire record and therefore we are only using the PUT verb.  From a database performance perspective
        it is normally better to replace part of the record than the whole record.</p>

     <p>That is enough lecture time, Let's start coding! Let's make a file named passenger.py in the folder myapp.</p>


     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>

# Get a list of passengers (Browse) ==========================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger', methods=['GET'])
def passenger_browse():

    # The active flag shows only the 'non-deleted' items
    # If you want to see everything pass active=0
    active = request.args.get('active', default='1', type=int)

    # It is a best practice to limit the amount of data an
    # API will allow a user to retrieve on a single call

    data = g.c.fetchall()

    return jsonify(data)</pre></p>

    <p>Normally, I'd talk through every line of this code.  But it's been a while since
       we've run our code (since we are just now at a point that we can).  Let's run
       everything and make sure it compiles.</p>

     <p>Open a new terminal and login to the server.  We want two windows so we have
        one in which we can edit our code and one where we can keep the application running.
        We will use our run.py script to run the application. Since we didn't chmod it in step
        8 let's chmod it now and then run it.  You can use the following commands.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
cd
cd rest_api
chmod u+x run.py
./run.py
</pre></p>

    <p>You should see the following if it worked:</p>

    <p><img src='/static/img/rest_api/step.9.1.png'></p>

    <p>If it didn't work, you may need to talk to an industry professional to get it working.
       This is a Hack-a-thon after all so time is very limited.</p>

    <p>Pro Tip: You can press tab in a terminal and it will type for you.  So to run this you
       could type `./ru&lt;tab&gt;` and it will type the n.py for you.  You have to type
       the `ru` since there is also the `read_sql.py` and you have to type enough that
       there is only one choice left.  If there is more than one choice it will type
       everything up until it can't decided which one you want.  This is called tab completion.</p>

   <p>Assuming it ran and you saw what you expected to see let's talk through what is happening in our newest
      code.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
#!/usr/bin/python3
# Passenger API - v1.0</pre></p>

     <p>You've seen that first line a bunch of times.  What you haven't seen is a comment at the top
        of the file telling the next developer what they are seeing. Guido Von Rossum, the creator
        of Python, stressed that code is read much more often than it is written.  Commenting
        drastically improves your ability to maintain code.  In the industry we talk about
        writing readable code (`Code Readability`).  This is a subtle but important comment line.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
from myapp import app
from flask import jsonify
from flask import request
from flask import g</pre></p>

     <p>The app module is the module we are building.  By importing it we get Flask and our code in
        the __init__.py file.  The jsonify module will help us build a JSON response.  More on this
        in a minute.  You've seen the request and g modules before.  By importing the g module
        we gain access to the things we loaded into g in the __init__.py.</p>

"""</pre></p>

     <p>You can do `block comments` in Python using either the ''' or the """.
        This comment is telling the developer how to name their functions to
        avoid issues.  This is important because you will be working on the
        same code as others in the group.  If you both name a function the
        same thing (even in different files) it will cause issues.</p>


     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Get a list of passengers (Browse) ==========================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger', methods=['GET'])
def passenger_browse():</pre></p>

     <p>In Flask you define a route using a Python decorator (the `@` shows a decorator).
        In this decorator we put our URL as `/api/1.0/passenger`.  I prefer to add
        /api and the /1.0 to indicate to anyone `calling` our API what it is and what
        version they are using.  There is an idea that when you release an API to the world
        you are making a contract that this API will always work the way it works at the
        moment you release it.  The reality is that you will need to change it because
        something new will be added or you'll think of a better way to do something.
        By changing the version number when you `break contract` you will help people
        using your API.  You can also run multiple versions at the same time to
        give users a chance to update their code before you turn the old version off.</p>

     <p>This may actually matter during HackMT.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    # The active flag shows only the 'non-deleted' items
    # If you want to see everything pass active=0
    active = request.args.get('active', default='1', type=int)

    # It is a best practice to limit the amount of data an
    # API will allow a user to retrieve on a single call
    # This creates a throttle to protect the server.
    # In this case we are just defaulting to 10 but will let
    # them ask for more
    limit = request.args.get('limit', default='10', type=int)</pre></p>

     <p>These two lines of code (and 7 lines of comments) are setting default values
        and then letting the API user override them.  We set an active flag to indicate
        whether or not something has been deleted.  We set a limit to protect the server.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    # Get the employee records
    g.c.execute('''SELECT rowid, name, active
                     FROM passenger
                    WHERE active=?
                    LIMIT ?''', (active, limit))
    data = g.c.fetchall()</pre></p>

    <p>You've seen selects and c.fetchall() before.  In this case the g.c.fetchall() uses the cursor
       we created in the __init__.py.  The other new idea here is the LIMIT in the SQL query.  LIMIT
       in SQLite (and MySQL) tells the database to only give us back that number of rows.  We've defaulted
       that to 10 rows.  You need to pick a default that makes sense for your application.  For example,
       if you are displaying 50 rows on a page, it would be better to raise the limit to 50 instead of
       calling the API 5 times with a LIMIT of 10.  As with all programming, you may need to try a few
       values to see what is faster.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    # Send the data back as JSON
    return jsonify(data)</pre></p>

    <p>This line uses Flask's built in jsonify() method to return the data from the query in a
       JSON format.  JSON is the native format that JavaScript
       can directly import.  It is very lightweight (especially compared to XML) and developer readable (most humans
       can't read JSON but most developers can).  In this case the JSON should look like this:</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-json'>
[
  {
    "active": 1,
    "name": "Keanu Reeves",
    "rowid": 1
  },
  {
    "active": 1,
    "name": "Laurence Fishburne",
    "rowid": 2
  },
  {
    "active": 1,
    "name": "Carrie-Anne Moss",
    "rowid": 3
  }
]</pre></p>

   <p>We would say it's a list of objects in JSON.  If this same data structure was in Python we'd call it a
      list of dictionaries.  You can see each row in our database got it's own {} and they are name value pairs.
      This makes it especially easy to parse or display on a website.</p>

    <p>Let's open another terminal (or use a free one if you already have 3) and test our endpoint to see
       if that's what we get back.  Having multiple terminals open will make you a faster developer.
       This is why most development shops give developers multiple monitors.  The more we have open
       that more we can see and the faster we work.  A $150 monitor will pay for itself in a week of increased
       productivity.</p>

    <p>We will use the bash command `curl` to check our URL.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X GET http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger</pre></p>

    <p>You should have seen the same thing as the JSON above.  The -X argument sends
       the specific HTTP verb (in this case GET).  This will be very helpful in our next steps.</p>

    <p>It's time to add our next funciton.  Please past the following read() function into your passenger.py.
       Python prefers that you have two blank lines between functions.</p>

     <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Get Data for a single passenger (Read) ======================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger/&lt;passenger_id&gt;', methods=['GET'])
def passenger_read(passenger_id):

    # Return the all columns for this one employee
    g.c.execute('''
                  SELECT rowid, name, active
                    FROM passenger
                   WHERE active = 1
                     AND rowid = ?
                ''', (passenger_id))
    data = g.c.fetchone()

    # Return in JSON format
    return jsonify(data)</pre></p>

    <p>This is very similar to the Browse function, but in this case we are passing a specific
       id and then adding that to our WHERE clause.  This will only pull back one row so we use
       the fetchone() instead of fetchall().</p>

    <p>Save the file by pressing `:w` and watch it reload in the terminal where flask is running.
       Let's test our new endpoint.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X GET http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger/1</pre></p>

    <p>Notice the 1 at the end of the line.  We are asking for the record with id 1.  In this case that
       will be Keanu.  When Flask sees the id on the end of the line it knows to route to the read() instead
       of the browse().</p>

    <p>When you run that command You should see a line in the flask window like this (without color):</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
10.8.0.1 - - [14/Jan/2018 16:18:34] "GET /api/1.0/passenger/1 HTTP/1.1" 200 -</pre></p>

    <p>At the end of that line there is a 200.  That 200 means everything is OK.  If you see
       a 500, 404 or 400 then you've got problems and you need to talk to a mentor.</p>

    <p>The output from the curl command should look like this:</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
{
  "active": 1,
  "name": "Keanu Reeves",
  "rowid": 1
}</pre></p>

    <p>Now we can add the Edit().  Please paste the following code at the bottom of passenger.py:</p>

    <p>In vim you can press capital 'O' (letter not number) and it will put in you Insert Mode
       on the line below the line you are on.  You have to press escape to be in 'normal' mode
       first.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Update Single Passenger (Edit) ==============================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger/&lt;passenger_id&gt;', methods=['PUT'])
def passenger_edit(passenger_id):

    # User input
    name = request.form.get('name')

    # Let's tell the user they forget to send values we need
    if not name:
       return jsonify({'success': False, 'error': 'Missing values'})

    g.c.execute('''
                  UPDATE passenger
                     SET name=?,
                         active=1
                   WHERE rowid=?
                ''', (name, passenger_id))
    g.conn.commit()

    # Let's tell them it worked
    return jsonify({'success': True})</pre></p>

    <p>There are a couple of new concepts here.  Let's discuss.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Update Single Passenger (Edit) ==============================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger/&lt;passenger_id&gt;', methods=['PUT'])
def passenger_edit(passenger_id):</pre></p>

    <p>This is the same as the Read function with the exception of the PUT keyword and the
       name of the function.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    # User input
    name = request.form.get('name')</pre></p>

    <p>When the user sends us values they won't be on the URL.  They will be in the `body`
       of the request.  Using request.form.get() is a safe way to retrieve these
       because the program won't crash if they forgot to send them.  In this case
       we are looking for the `name` value to be sent from the user.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    # Let's tell the user they forget to send values we need
    if not name:
       return jsonify({'success': False, 'error': 'Missing values'})</pre></p>

    <p>If they forgot to send us the name, we need to tell them they messed up.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    g.c.execute('''
                  UPDATE passenger
                     SET name=?,
                         active=1
                   WHERE rowid=?
                ''', (name, passenger_id))
    g.conn.commit()</pre></p>

    <p>This is a SQL UPDATE statement.  It is similar to the INSERT but you have to line up
       the values in the SET section.  You might notice we put active=1 in this query.
       I decided that you shouldn't edit a deleted record, so editing a deleted one
       will activate it.  This also aligns with the idea of PUT replacing the entire
       record.  There is also a g.conn.commit().  Just like in the load_sql.py script,
       this saves the changes to the database file.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
    # Let's tell them it worked
    return jsonify({'success': True})</pre></p>

    <p>If we got this far then everything worked so we can send back a success True message.</p>

    <p>Let's test our edit with curl:</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X PUT -d 'name=Bilbo Baggins' http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger/2</pre></p>

    <p>If this works we will change Laurence Fishburne's name to Bilbo Baggins.  He will love that.  You can see
       the updated record by either running ./read_sql.py or by using the following curl command.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X GET http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger/2</pre></p>

    <p>Only two more functions to go.</p>

    <p>Another vim tip, you can jump to the bottom of a file by pressing `:$` and then hitting enter.
       The $ represents the last line of a file.  You can also jump to specific line numbers by
       pressing :111 to jump to line 111.  This is useful if you get an error on a line.</p>

    <p>Please paste the following at the bottom of the passenger.py. Remember to by in insert mode.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Insert Single Passenger (Add) ===============================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger', methods=['POST'])
def passenger_add():

    # User input
    name = request.form.get('name')

    # Let's tell the user they forget to send values we need
    if not name:
       return jsonify({'success': False, 'error': 'Missing values'})

    g.c.execute('''
                  INSERT INTO passenger
                       VALUES (?, ?)
                ''', (name, 1))
    g.conn.commit()

    # Let's tell them it worked
    return jsonify({'success': True})</pre></p>

    <p>Almost identical to the edit() function with the following differences.  We don't pass an id on the
       url because SQLite will assign one for us.  We also use an INSERT statement (you've seen these in the
       load_sql.py script.  Last callout is the POST HTTP verb.  Everything else is the same.</p>

    <p>Let's test it.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X POST -d 'name=Hugo Weaving' http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger</pre></p>

    <p>This movie needed a bad guy so adding Hugo Smith (Agent Smith) felt right.</p>

    <p>You can verify it worked by running ./read_sql.py or the following CURL command (calls Browse)</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X GET http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger</pre></p>

    <p>Let's add our final endpoint for the Passenger API.  Please paste the following into the bottom of
       your passenger.py:</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-python'>
# Delete Single Passenger (Delete) ============================================
@app.route('/api/1.0/passenger/&lt;passenger_id&gt;', methods=['DELETE'])
def passenger_delete(passenger_id):

    # Set the active flag to 0 which will make them appear deleted
    g.c.execute('''UPDATE passenger
                      SET active=0
                    WHERE rowid=?''', passenger_id)
    g.conn.commit()

    # Tell the user it worked
    return jsonify({'success': True})
</pre></p>

    <p>This function uses the DELETE HTTP verb and an UPDATE SQL statement.  The reason
       we are marking this deleted instead of using the DELETE SQL statement to remove
       them has to do with a concept called referential integrity.  The idea will make
       more sense when we build the Trip endpoint but if you consider the tables
       at the top of the tutorial.  If someone built a report from the Trip
       table that referenced the Passenger Table to see who rode in one of our cars in the
       last month, and we had deleted a couple passengers out of the table, we've
       broken the reference table that Trip was counting on.  So we say that you
       need to maintain referential integrity to protect the data in the database.</p>

    <p>Typically you wouldn't delete data from a database.  If you do then you need to
       consider all of the references and delete them all.</p>

    <p>Let's test our delete() by deleting Bilbo.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X DELETE http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger/2</pre></p>

    <p>Like before you can verify it worked by running ./read_sql.py or the following CURL command (calls Browse)</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X GET http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger</pre></p>

    <p>Now if you try to get record 2 you'll get a `null` response.  Cause it's not technically
       there any more.</p>

    <p><pre class='prettyprint lang-bash'>
curl -X GET http://{{request.cookies.vm_name}}:5001/api/1.0/passenger/2</pre></p>

    <p>Good Job!  This was a big step and you hopefully are much smarter than you were at the top
       of this file.  I suspect the next two steps will go much faster for you.</p>
