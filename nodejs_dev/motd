Welcome to your personal Dev VM!

You've chosen a node.js VM (or you need to talk to Kenny and he will help you
switch).  This VM will be yours throughout the rest of the Hack-a-thon.  Be
kind to your VM and it will treat you well.

There are helpful python examples in the /tmp/examples folder.  

They will help you get started on any of the tasks you are assigned.

If you have questions feel free to ask in the #hackmt team channel.

Note: Don't do anything illegal from this VM or Kenny will turn you in.
